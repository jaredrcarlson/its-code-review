# Jared Carlson - Idaho ITS Code Review


This repository is a **curated code portfolio** created specifically for the **Idaho ITS code review process**.  
It highlights projects that best demonstrate my ability to:  

- Build and secure **full-stack applications**  
- Apply **computer science fundamentals** (algorithms, testing, documentation)  
- Collaborate in an **Agile environment** with clear communication
